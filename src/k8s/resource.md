# What's resource
 
I thinks this image explain it very well: https://dev4devs.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/kupa_0104.png.

The image is somebody's work, so thank them.

Basically, resource is similar to class, When you programing, don't write a big chunk of code in single clourse,
resource seperate them into individual yaml file so its complexity is under controlled.

## Common type of resource

- Pod
  A set of running container(that is guaranteed to be on same physical machine)

  Generally, you don't write Pod yaml file, it's generated by `ReplicatSet`.

- Deployment
  A blueprint for construction of Pod

- ReplicatSet
  A Plan to decide how many Pod should be created from some blueprint

- Service
  Defined what port and what proto(tcp/udp/grpc) on what Pod(or no pod if unavailable)

## Selector and metadata

In the diagram, it's obvious that some connection is made between Service and Pod, that's what we called `selector`.

In Service yaml, we need to defined such thing
```yaml
selector:
   key-abc: efg
```

In Pod yaml, there is...
```yaml
metadata:
    key-abc: efg
```

It should matched, so k8s is able to find your Pod open some port.
